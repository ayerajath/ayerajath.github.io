My name is **Rajath Aithal**. Based out of Bangalore. 

I'm currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer** at Playsimple Games. 

I’ve adored programming/coding. I’m really interested in startups, SaaS, and Product. Attempting to learn more about finance and economics as well.

Yes, I try to be a jack of all trades.

Here's a panda, because I like them. And, the world needs a little more love & happiness.
