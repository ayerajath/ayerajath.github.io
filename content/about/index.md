My name is **Rajath Aithal**. Based out of Bangalore. 

I'm currently working as a **Senior Software Engineer** at Playsimple Games. 

I’ve adored programming/coding. I’m really interested in startups, SaaS, and Product. Attempting to learn more about finance and economics as well.

Yes, I try to be a jack of all trades.

The world is a wonderful place, but is filled with hatred against each other. I wish to change that and spread love, kindness, and smiles whenever I can.
