I was staring at the Strava app. It’s just a tracker for my runs (yes, it does more), but for me, the reason I keep coming back is the analytics.

It made me think — gamifying anything works. Add a sense of progress, competition, and suddenly it sticks. Duolingo gets this so right. The way they’ve gamified learning is beautiful. I find myself opening the app just to keep a streak going.

Underneath all of it, it’s the same thing: consistency. And behind that? Discipline.

I like being in office by 10:00 AM. Doesn’t matter that I’m at a startup — this small rule helps me get a head start on my day. I wake up at 6:00 AM most days. When I don’t, it feels off. I take pride in that routine.

I want to be consistent. And the only way to do that is through discipline. Do the same thing every day. Try it for a week. See what happens. I want to gamify the things I care about. Pick something, do it every day — even if it’s just for 10 minutes. That’s how I hope to become a better software engineer. A better person.

Just a slightly better version of myself than yesterday. Even something as small as reading a book for 15 minutes — it only works if I make the space to actually do it.
