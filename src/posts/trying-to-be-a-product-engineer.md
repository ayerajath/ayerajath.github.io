When I started coding, I thought the experience layer wasn't for me. I was wrong.

I believed backend was where the real action happened. I still love it, and there's a charm about backend and systems that draws me in.

But to truly understand your impact, you need to grasp the experience layer. Every user interaction with your product is a learning opportunity:
- How do users find the product?
- What do they do?
- What do they think?
- What do they like or dislike?

As an engineer, it's crucial to align your goals:
1. Company goals
2. Team goals
3. Product goals
4. Personal goals

The biggest wins often come from product goals.

While backend remains important and interesting, I can no longer ignore the experience layer or pretend it's not my thing.

Companies like PostHog and Linear showcase great product engineers. They operate with few Product Managers, which I find fascinating.

I'm eager to learn more about experiences, product, and business. Joining a young startup like Houseware gives me that opportunity.
