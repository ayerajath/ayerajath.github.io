When I started coding, I thought the experience layer wasn't for me. I was wrong.

I believed backend was where the real action happened. I still love it, and there's a charm about backend and systems that draws me in.

But to truly understand your impact, you need to grasp the experience layer. Every user interaction with your product is a learning opportunity. Think about how users first discover what you’ve built, the actions they take, and the thoughts or feelings that arise as they engage with it. Their likes, dislikes, and overall impressions all become valuable feedback.

The biggest wins often come from product goals.

While backend remains important and interesting, I can no longer ignore the experience layer or pretend it's not my thing.

Companies like PostHog and Linear showcase great product engineers. They operate with few Product Managers, which I find fascinating.

I'm eager to learn more about experiences, product, and business. Joining a young startup like Houseware gives me that opportunity.
